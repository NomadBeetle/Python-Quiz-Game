# Python Quiz Game 

A simple True/False quiz game built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project dynamically loads questions, keeps track of the user's score, and allows them to exit at any time.

## Features 
- Loads trivia questions dynamically from a dataset.
- Keeps track of the user's score throughout the game.
- Allows the user to exit anytime by typing "exit".
- Uses **OOP principles** (classes and objects) for a structured approach.

## How It Works 
1. The game pulls a list of True/False questions from `data.py`.
2. Each question is stored as an object using the `Question` class.
3. The `QuizBrain` class manages the question flow and score tracking.
4. The user answers each question until the quiz ends, or they choose to exit.
5. The final score is displayed at the end.
